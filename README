gkrellm_snmp: GKrellM SNMP monitor Plugin
Author:    Christian W. Zuckschwerdt <zany@triq.net>
Homepage:  http://triq.net/gkrellm/


A plugin for GKrellM, that let's you monitor SNMP vars.


Compiling:
===========

* For linux: just run the normal 'make'.
* For freebsd: run 'make freebsd'.


Installing:
===========
Running 'make install' will place the plugin under
/usr/share/gkrellm/plugins. You can also manually place the resulting
gkrellm_snmp.so under ~/.gkrellm/plugins. After restarting gkrellm, you
should be able to enable it in the gkrellm plugins configuration menu.


Troubleshooting:
================
If you have trouble compiling the plugin. Make sure you have gtk 1.2 and 
gkrellm >= 0.9.8 and you've installed the gkrellm header files in
/usr/include/gkrellm or /usr/local/include/gkrellm. If you have placed the
header files in some other dir, edit GKRELLM_INCLUDE in the Makefile
 
Bugs:
=====
Hopefully none, but running on FreeBSD is not tested very well,
please mail any problems/bugs to me...


Some example:
=============

The ambiente temperature sensor for Oldenburg i.O., Germany
(see http://www.PMNET.uni-oldenburg.de/temperatur.php3)

is world readable using the following pseudo URL
snmp://public@134.106.172.2/.1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.8.1.101.1

That is:
 SNMP peer "134.106.172.2" (kyle.pmnet.uni-oldenburg.de)
 SNMP community name "public"
 SNMP oid ".1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.8.1.101.1"


Interesting questions:
======================

Do you want/need
 monitor multiple oid's at once?
 charts instead of krells?
 SNMP v1, v2, v3 support?
 SNMP privacy options?

 Enter peer, port, community and oid in separate fields
 or as snmp://community@peer:port/oid ?

 other SNMP lib instead of UCD-SNMPD ?
 GKrellM pre 0.9.8 support/compatibility?

 instance mapping?


Please help:
============

Can you give some usage examples?
