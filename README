gkrellm_snmp: GKrellM SNMP monitor Plugin
Author:    Christian W. Zuckschwerdt <zany@triq.net>
Homepage:  http://triq.net/gkrellm/


A plugin for GKrellM, that let's you monitor SNMP vars.


Prerequisites:
===============
You need a SNMP library to run this plugin.
You also need the header (include) files for building.
Tested with UCD-SNMP >= 4.0.0 ( http://ucd-snmp.ucdavis.edu/ ).
(If you want to try -old- CMU-SNMP, please mail some feedback).


Compiling:
===========

* For linux: just run the normal 'make'.
* For freebsd: run 'make freebsd'.


Installing:
===========
Running 'make install-user' will place the plugin in your current home
directory under ~/.gkrellm/plugins.
Running 'make install' as superuser will place the plugin under
/usr/share/gkrellm/plugins. You can also manually place the resulting
gkrellm_snmp.so under ~/.gkrellm/plugins. After restarting gkrellm, you
should be able to enable it in the gkrellm plugins configuration menu.


Troubleshooting:
================
If you have trouble compiling the plugin. Make sure you have gtk 1.2 and 
gkrellm >= 0.9.8 and you've installed the gkrellm header files in
/usr/include/gkrellm or /usr/local/include/gkrellm. If you have placed the
header files in some other dir, edit GKRELLM_INCLUDE in the Makefile

 
Bugs:
=====
I do consider this version stable.
please mail any problems/bugs to me...


Some example:
=============

(1)

The ambiente temperature sensor for Oldenburg i.O., Germany
(see http://www.PMNET.uni-oldenburg.de/temperatur.php3)

is world readable using the following pseudo URL
snmp://public@134.106.172.2:161/.1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.8.1.101.1

That is:
 SNMP peer "134.106.172.2" (kyle.pmnet.uni-oldenburg.de)
 SNMP port "161" (that's the default)
 SNMP community name "public"
 SNMP oid ".1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.8.1.101.1"


(2)

Server CPU load using a string ranging from 0.00 to 1.00

snmp://public@134.106.120.1:161/.1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.10.1.3.1
(Thats the load factor for PMNET's Stan)

(3)

Server CPU load using integer variable ranging from 0 to 100

snmp://public@134.106.172.2:161/.1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.10.1.5.1
(Thats the percentile load on PMNET's Kyle)


More interessting OIDs:
=======================
- Chasis inlet temperature (tested on cisco7204VXR)
 .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.13.1.3.1.3.1

Be always sure to prepend the leading dot "." it's much like the
root "/" in path names.
Mostly there is a trailing ".0" do not omit it -- it selects the first
row (E.g. there could be more that just one value).


Call for features!
==================

Do you want/need
 monitor multiple oid's on the same server? (snmp bulk get)
 charts instead of krells?
 SNMP v1, v2, v3 support?
 SNMP privacy options?

 Enter peer, port, community and oid in separate fields
 or as snmp://community@peer:port/oid ?

 other SNMP lib instead of UCD-SNMPD ?
 GKrellM pre 0.9.8 support/compatibility?

 instance mapping?

 Diffential monitors (eg. monitor packet counters instead of gauges)?


Please help:
============

Can you give some usage examples?



Tested on:
==========
FreeBSD  4.0 Release   w/ ucd-snmp-4.0.1   libcrypt not needed
SuSE Linux 6.4   w/ ucd-snmp-4.0.1
SuSE Linux 6.4   w/ ucd-snmp-4.1.1
RedHad Linux 6.1
