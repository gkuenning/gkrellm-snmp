The libcrypto ispart of OpenSSL.
Which libs is libsnmp compiled against?
Try 'ldd /usr/lib/libsnmp.so' YMMV
Mine is compiled staticly -- so I don't need to link against any lib.

If seen at least one broken router (cisco-2514 w/ IOS Version 11.2(5))
reporting the wrong ASN.1 type (ASN_BOOLEAN instead of ASN_INTEGER).
Please report the offending OID's and I'll see if there's a workaround
possible.
