The libcrypto ispart of OpenSSL.
Which libs is libsnmp compiled against?
Try 'ldd /usr/lib/libsnmp.so' YMMV
Mine is compiled staticly -- so I don't need to link against any lib.

There is some broken hardware and some ASN.1 types aren't implemented, yet.
Please report the offending OID's and I'll see if there's a workaround
possible.
