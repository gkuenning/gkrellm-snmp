Do you want/need
 monitor multiple oid's on the same server? (snmp bulk get)

 Enter peer, port, community and oid in separate fields
 or as snmp://community@peer:port/oid ?

 GKrellM pre 0.9.8 support/compatibility?

Very nice ! I wonder if it would be possible to 
receive SNMP notifications (a.k.a traps) ?
The actual SNMP trap could be written to syslog
and only an indication of a received trap could
be visible.

For example, it would be cool to be able to
define a text, for example: XYZ, which is
displayed in the GKrellM monitor. When a 
SNMP trap is received, the text chould change
color and/or start to flash. When the user
notice this he checks his syslog output.

-> candidate for some next release
   trap message could be viewed as bubble help (popup).
