Do you want/need
 monitor multiple oid's on the same server? (snmp bulk get)

 Enter peer, port, community and oid in separate fields
 or as snmp://community@peer:port/oid ?

 other SNMP lib instead of UCD-SNMPD ?
 GKrellM pre 0.9.8 support/compatibility?

 Diffential monitors (eg. monitor packet counters instead of gauges)?
